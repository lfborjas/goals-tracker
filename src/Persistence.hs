Using a modified version of the example in:

https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sqlite-simple-0.4.16.0/docs/Database-SQLite-Simple.html

We get

Î»> migrate
Account {id_ = 1, name = "test account", balance = 333.33}
Account {id_ = 2, name = "test account 2", balance = 333.33}


Next Steps:

in existing modules
* go back to using M.Account, figure out the actual model and then modify the JSON And Row
serializers to work with the bits they need.
* implement an accountHistory table that tracks balance over time

in Lib module
* plot a history of a given account
* implement a createFromAPI method in a new module, to persist an account from the API
* implement an updateAllFromAPI method in a new module, to update existing accounts from the API
* implement a Goal model, join table with Accounts?

in main:
* ???

open questions: to keep imports sane, should Models be importing Persistence and YNAB
and defining its serializers/helper methods there?


* implement the actual UI:
- make the hello world work
- plot some existing account data in gtk (make sure we can plot to begin with)
-
